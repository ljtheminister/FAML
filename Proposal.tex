\section{Problem}
The data set is a commercial building's steam usage discretized in 15-minute intervals throughout the day.  The problem is to make predictions on steam usage based on weather prediction data as well as by building an $n$-order Markov chain feature vector.  This problem is of interest because the more out-of-the box algorithms such as linear, Support Vector, and Random Forest regressions have proven to be ineffective in their predictions.

\section{Proposal}
Thus, we are proposing to tackle this time-series prediction problem using grapical model based approaches such as HMMs, LDS, and neural networks to improve prediction oucomes.
